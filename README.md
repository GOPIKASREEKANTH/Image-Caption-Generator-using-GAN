## Image-Caption-Generator-using-GAN

##### The convergence of computer vision and natural language processing has led to the emergence of image captioning technology, which automatically generates descriptive textual descriptions for images. Image captioning finds applications across various domains, including social media, ecommerce, education, healthcare, news agencies, and autonomous vehicles. Techniques for image captioning often involve convolutional neural networks (CNN) for image representation and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sentence generation. To enhance the diversity and naturalness of generated captions, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been employed. In this project, GANs are utilized along with CNN and LSTM for image captioning. GAN-based image captioning offers advantages such as enhanced realism and diversity, improved contextual understanding, and reduced overreliance on training data, making it an effective approach for generating captions for images.
